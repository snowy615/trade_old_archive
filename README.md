## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Update Frequency
By default, the system updates every 5 minutes. You can modify this in `real_time_system.py`:
```python
self.update_interval = 5  # Change to desired minutes
```

### News Sources
Add or modify news sources in `news_analyzer.py`:
```python
self.news_sources = {
    'your_source': 'https://example.com/rss',
    # ... existing sources
}
```

### Prediction Horizons
Adjust prediction timeframes in `enhanced_predictor.py`:
```python
hours_ahead = [1, 4, 24]  # Modify as needed
```

## üìù Logging

The system creates detailed logs in:
- `gbpusd_system.log`: Main system operations
- Console output: Real-time status updates

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No data retrieved" Error**
- Check internet connection
- Verify RSS feeds are accessible
- Some sources may have rate limits

**Model Training Fails**
- Ensure sufficient historical data
- Check available memory (LSTM training requires ~2GB)
- Verify TensorFlow installation

**Dashboard Not Loading**
- Check if port 5000 is available
- Ensure Flask dependencies are installed
- Check firewall settings

**Prediction Accuracy Low**
- More historical data improves accuracy
- Consider adjusting feature weights
- Monitor news relevance scores

### Performance Optimization

**For Better Speed**
- Enable GPU support for TensorFlow
- Use faster RSS parsing libraries
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data

**For Lower Resource Usage**
- Reduce update frequency
- Limit news history retention
- Use smaller LSTM model

## üìà Future Enhancements
